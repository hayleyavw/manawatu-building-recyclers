					<p>
						Hello, my name is Ross van Waas.
					</p>
					<p>
						I have had nearly 30 years experience in the recycling business. I started out working for a large recycling business in Wellington for 5 years, before branching out to set up my own recycling shop.
					</p>
					<p>
						My first shop opened in 1996, in Porirua (and is still open and operating under the new owner who took it over from me in 2002).
					</p>
					<p>
						At this time my family and I were living in Paraparaumu, and we decided to start again, this time in Palmerston North. I found a suitable premises on Bourke Street, and spent the first year commuting 6 days a week, before eventually moving to Palmerston North, and we have been here ever since.
					</p>
					<p>
						Initially I set up a shop dealing in anything that came out of an average house, and which was good enough to be reused. In late 2010 I relocated across the road to a smaller but newer and brighter building, and decided to concentrate on just Windows and Doors, and also new Kitchens.
					</p>
					<p>
						We also have a full display kitchen on show in the shop, as I sell new modular kitchens , made to order. Bring your plan and I would be happy to price one of our kitchens for you.
					</p>
					<p>
						Come on in or give us a call, I’m happy to help you find what you’re looking for!
					</p>
					<p>
						Ross.
					</p>
